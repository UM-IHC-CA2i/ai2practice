## Dataset description

`data/radiology_ai_findings.csv` contains 60 anonymized radiology studies across 4 imaging modalities (CR, CT, MR, US) and 7 body regions. Each study records whether an AI tool flagged a finding, the AI's confidence score, and whether a radiologist confirmed the finding.

This data is synthetic and designed for educational purposes.
